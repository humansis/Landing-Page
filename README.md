Humansis
==============

## About

A platform that allows humanitarian organisations to manage relief items (Food, Non Food Items, Cash, etc) to people in need for life-saving humanitarian responses to emergency situations.

Humansis is the first fully open-source relief platform for humanitarian actors to efficiently manage relief operations after a disaster, during a war or in response to long term crises. 

The global project documentation is available on the frontend [repository](https://github.com/ReliefApplications/bms_front).
